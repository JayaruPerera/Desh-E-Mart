# Desha E-Mart

Desha E-Mart is a web platform created to support the community as part of a Community Project course module. This website was developed for Desha E-Mart, a mobile phone shop located near the Sabaragamuwa University. The shop is a primary destination for students to purchase accessories and repair their mobile devices. By digitizing the shopâ€™s services, this platform aims to make it more accessible and convenient for students.
